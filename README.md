Card searcher and deck builder for Yu-Gi-Oh!

V1.1:
- Card info now overlays the screen in deck-builder to improve UI for mobile users
- Multiple other size and position adjustments for improved mobile experience
- Removed "Add Card" button in favour of the "Auto-add" feature
- A popup on the top left corner is added to indicate that a card is added
- Bug fix: Main deck cards were showing when empty spaces in extra deck are clicked
- Bug fix: Cards without images no longer crash the webpage, and are now displayed with a default image instead
