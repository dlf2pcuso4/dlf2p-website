var jsonResponseArticle={title:"Braver Victory - First Look",author:"DLF2P",text:"Braver Victory contains support for Ancient Gear, Battlewasp, Trains, Dracoslayer, Gimmick Puppet, Infernoid, Inzektor, Mekk Knight, Metalfoes, Krawler, and some other stuff.<br><br>[Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall]<br><br>Mekk Knights are perhaps the best archetype in this box. Capable of being a meta contender, the deck can make really consistent and strong negate boards making use of the column mechanic when going first, and get extra searches from Blue Sky and spam big Mekk Knights when going second. Although the deck isn't too hard to counter when their full negate board isn't properly set up yet, especially when going second, it becomes extremely difficult to beat when there is a Mekk Knight in all 3 columns. The deck is also fairly cheap because all of the Mekk Knight cards you need come from this box.<br><br>[Infernoid Devyaty]<br><br>Infernoids can consistently make a negate turn 1 with Decatron copying your boss monster's effect, and can make really explosive plays depending on the playstyle you prefer. Some builds play a more controlled version using Void Feast to special summon from the deck, and some explosive builds use milling effects like the Lightsworn engine to fill up the graveyard for banish fodder. The deck is also a really strong counter to graveyard decks because all of the low level Infernoids can banish cards from the opponent's graveyard. The deck still has some weaknesses, most notably being very vulnerable to disruptions and backrow removal&nbsp;when going second.<br><br>[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]<br><br>The Dracoslayer engine can be used alongside a lot of other pendulum archetypes, which make the deck very versatile. The deck also has consistent access to card removal using&nbsp;Ignister Prominence. Dracoslayers have a lot of potential, and it will require some time for players to find an optimised build for the deck.<br><br>[Raremetalfoes Bismugear]<br><br>Not only did Metalfoes receive a really good main deck monster that gives the deck a much better follow up, they can also use the new Dracoslayer support to make the deck more consistent and make more explosive plays. Metalfoes were already quite a decent deck even before the new support, and the new cards they got may possibly bring them back in the meta.<br><br>[Ancient Gear Megaton Golem][Battlewasp - Ballista the Armageddon]<br><br>Ancient Gears and Battlewasps got more support that make both decks more consistent and give them a better boss monster. Both decks are still not competitive, but the cards in this box are essential if you want to build these 2 decks.<br><br>[Double Headed Anger Knuckle][Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll]<br><br>Trains and Gimmick Puppets have a new link 2 monster to boost their consistency and follow up. Especially for Gimmik Puppets, Chimera Doll lets you use monsters with different levels and turn bricky hands into good ones. These 2 link monsters might finally make their respective decks competitively viable.<br><br>Overall, the box is quite good because of the competitive potential of Mekk Knights and Infernoids, both being a fairly cheap deck that has all of their supports in a single box. Mekk Knights can also be splashed into other decks for extra materials for extra deck summons.",date:"Nov 09, 2022",};
