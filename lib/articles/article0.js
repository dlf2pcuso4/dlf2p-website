var jsonResponseArticle={title:"Top 5 F2P Decks October 2022",author:"DLF2P",text:"Here we take a look at the best F2P decks in October 2022 for PVP, and rank them according to how competitive it is and how well it performs in the current meta. The choices will likely change according to the meta in the future.<br><br>#1: Fluffal<br>[Fluffal Dog]<br>An extremely aggressive deck. Although their turn 1 play is basically only Kiteroid, the deck can consistently break boards, overwhelm the opponent with card advantage, and attack multiple times. Most importantly, this deck can play through generic backrow like Book of Moon without a problem, which makes Fluffals one of the hardest decks to defend against.<br><br>#2: Salamangreat<br>[Salamangreat Roar]<br>Despite what recent tier lists may imply, Salamangreats are far less powerful in the best-of-1 format in Duel Links outside of tournaments, but even without other expensive staples, this F2P deck can still make a negate every turn, albeit a bit less consistently. The deck can generate an impressive amount of card advantage, and adding in anti-meta staples can definitely make the deck a lot more competitive.<br><br>#3: Ice Barrier<br>[Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier]<br>Although Ice Barriers don’t have access to a consistency skill like the other decks on this list, nor have enough deck space to play a lot of backrow, the deck makes up for these weaknesses by consistently making extremely threatening synchro monsters that banish cards without targeting. Warlock or Spellbreaker of the Ice Barrier are also really good anti meta choices against decks like Photons to shut down their spell cards.<br><br>#4: Meklord<br>[Meklord Army Deployer Obbligato]<br>Although F2P Meklord builds don’t have access to Triskelion, they now have access to the low rarity Dreadnought Dreadnoid and Great Magnus combo. Their skill lets them do 1 card combos extremely consistently and even draw 2 cards in turn 1. Mektimed Blast is also an excellent F2P archetype trap that destroys any of your opponent’s cards.<br><br>#5: World Chalice<br>[Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior]<br>There are many ways to play World Chalice, but one thing they have in common is the huge amount of link spamming potential the archetype is capable of. Using Labyrinth Wall minimises the risk of bricking and lets the deck run more staples while still keeping its explosivity. The deck has target negation, counters to extra deck monsters, non-destruction monster removal, and many ways to gain card advantage.<br><br>Be sure to check out the video for replays for each deck!<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvoVXhhmOs",date:"Oct 31, 2022",};
