  text: "Compulsory Evacuation Device [12467005] is limited to 3 immediately after it is released, because it is a powerful staple trap that has an extremely simple effect to return a monster back to the owner’s hand. This effect is short and simple, but just like M S T and Book of Moon, it is extremely strong and versatile. You can bounce your opponent’s monsters as well as your own in certain situations, and the versatility of Compulse is what makes it so good. Limiting it to 3 right after it is released is honestly not a bad idea, because it is undeniably a really good staple, but it’s funny to think that Book of Moon, a card that is arguably better than Compulse, was released from a selection box with absolutely no restrictions.",
