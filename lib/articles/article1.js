var jsonResponseArticle={title:"Counters to Salamangreats",author:"DLF2P",text:"Salamangreats have been terrorising Duel Links since its initial release with the Vrains world, especially in best-of-3 tournament formats, but in regular ranked duels and KC Cups, experienced players know that it isn't that hard of a deck to beat. Salamangreats have a number of significant weaknesses that can only be solved if they 'draw the out' or lose a whole lot of resources to bring out a situational and hard-to summon extra deck monster.<br><br>In this article I will be using the phrase 'drawing the out' a lot, that is because every deck has an out or some specific card that counters the deck, but if the out is unsearchable, you'll only be able to access it by drawing it, which is quite inconsistent. This is why having a searchable in-archetype out is much more preferable over 'drawing the out'.<br><br>[Salamangreat Heatleo]<br><br>One of the biggest weaknesses of the deck is its incredibly low stats. Their own archetype's monsters cap out at 2300ATK, and self-linking Heatleo means that you cannot self-link Sunlight Wolf using Sanctuary in the same turn. Even then, the deck can beat over 1 high attack monster at most, which becomes an issue when they face multiple monsters with more than 2300 ATK. While Needle Ceiling counters the opponent having multiple high attack monsters, that requires Salamangreats to 'draw the out', which itself can be prevented by generic backrow removal before it is activatable. It is also very difficult for Salamangreats to summon XYZ monsters while still having a strong backrow lineup, and the XYZ monsters are not protected by Balelynx, which makes them quite easy to get rid of.<br><br>[Salamangreat Jack Jaguar][Necrovalley]<br><br>As a graveyard reliant deck, anti-graveyard counters are extremely effective against Salamangreats. The deck gains its impressive card advantage by constantly recycling cards from the graveyard, including special summoning monsters from the graveyard for link material or reusing negates and searches. This is why players have been using Necrovalley to counter the deck. The floodgate effect of Necrovalley alone can win games against Salamangreats, and their in-archetype backrow removals don't work against Necrovalley. Foxy's graveyard effect is negated by Necrovalley, and Heatleo cannot target field spells with its effect, not to mention that some decks have the ability to search Necrovalley, making it a consistent out to Salamangreats. Again, Salamangreats have to either 'draw the out' or immediately concede. D-Fissure and the Sealed Tombs skill are also great graveyard counters to Salamangreats.<br><br>[Salamangreat Roar]<br><br>Salamangreats are heavily reliant on Roar to disrupt their opponents. Without Roar, the deck doesn't have any monster removal, making it hard to justify playing Salamangreats over other competitive decks that can set 3 and consistently make monsters with actually high stats. End boards without Roar are often just a few low ATK monsters like Sunlight Wolf and 1-2 set backrow, some of which (like Circle) don't even disrupt the opponent. Salamangreats without Roar are simply just Salaman-mid. That's why banishing Roar specifically from the graveyard or preventing it from being added to their hand weakens the deck so much. DD Crow is an obvious counter and perhaps the best staple against the deck, being able to counter Salamngreats even on turn 1. Some other decks that have searchable in-archetype graveyard banish effects or strong backrow removal don't even need to 'draw the out' by having DD Crow in their opening hand.<br><br>And most importantly, one of the major characteristics of Tier 0 decks is that the specific counters made to counter Tier 0 decks tend to lose to other meta decks, but many counters to Salamangreat are good generic staples that counter a lot of other decks, as most of the counters are anti-graveyard techs. For example, Necrovalley and DD Crow are excellent against Galaxy Photons, Heros and Rose Dragons, and DD Crow can even counter the graveyard effects of Burning Abyss and Atlantean monsters when they are sent as cost.<br><br>If you despise Salamangreats with the bottom of your heart, here are some decks that have in-archetype outs to Salamangreats (while also being decent against other decks) so that you don't have to rely on 'drawing the out' every time. The best type of deck against Salamangreats are pendulums, since they don't have a clear chokepoint in their combos and can spam multiple high attack monsters, which is difficult for Salamangreats to out.<br><br>[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]<br><br>Odd-Eyes are mainly considered the best deck to counter Salamangreats, as the deck can set scales without being negated using their skill, spam high attack monsters without activating an effect (which is usually only countered if Salamangreats 'draw the out' such as drawing Warning Point), and have access to Necrovalley. Making Abyss Dweller turn 1 also limits the explosivity of Salamangreat combos.<br><br>[Abyss Actor - Superstar]<br><br>Abyss Actors are very underrated in this meta. The reason why this deck counters the meta so well is because of their skill, Sealed Tombs. The deck can consistently trigger the skill every duel (without 'drawing the out') by using the pendulum effect of Mellow Madonna, and completely counter decks like Galaxy Photons that rely on special summoning from the graveyard and heavily restrict Salamangreat end boards. Even when going second, using Sealed Tombs ensures that Balelynx cannot protect their Salamangreat cards and eliminates their follow-up plays. The large amount of backrow removals in this deck not only increase the deck's consistency by popping Wild Hope, but also act as excellent counters to Salamangreat Roar and especially Eternal Soul from Dark Magicians. Superstar also counters one of the deadliest outs to pendulums - Warning Point and Floodgate Trap Hole. Since the chokepoint of the deck varies depending on their starting hand, most Salamangreat players keep their Roar to negate Superstar's effect, but this can be played around easily by not using Superstar's effect at all. A full board of pendulum monsters under Sealed Tombs is more than enough to completely exhaust a Salamangreat player's resources, and best of all, the deck is extremely cheap to build as their archetype cards come from a single mini box and their entire extra deck is optional.<br><br>[Qliphort Scout]<br><br>This is perhaps the cheapest anti-Salamangreat deck in the game. Only needing a single mini box and no extra deck cards, Qlis can consistently pump out threat after threat while chain-blocking Roar using cards like Qliphort Stealth. The deck itself is not very competitive, but it is an effective option to counter Salamangreats and have some fun in ranked.<br><br>[Darktellarknight Batlamyus]<br><br>Moving on from pendulums, Satellarknight actually have a pretty interesting (and consistent) out to Salamangreats specifically. Both Sunlight Wolf and Heatleo require FIRE effect monsters as their link material, and Batlamyus turns all monsters into DARK monsters, making your opponent unable to summon their best link monsters while Batlamyus is on the field.<br><br>In conclusion, there are tons of staples and in-archetype counters to Salamangreats that don't require 'drawing the out', and it is instead Salamangreat, the deck itself, that needs to draw the outs like Needle Ceiling and MST to counter its counters. I'm not saying that Salamangreats are bad, after all they're still a super consistent control deck that can negate every turn and spam links and XYZ monsters, but people need to understand that the deck is a lot less good than how it's portrayed by some people.<br>",date:"Nov 04, 2022",};
