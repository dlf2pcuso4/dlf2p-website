        text: "#1: Solfachord\nSolfachord excels at going first, and even in its F2P version, having the United Pendulums skill and Elegance’s draw 2 effect makes the deck super consistent at making multiple disruptions. Being a pendulum deck, the deck is good at spamming monsters and pushing for game, the field spell has a good recursion effect and pops cards without targeting, and Gracia and Angelia shuts down monster effects and spell/trap effects respectively when your monsters attack. The extra deck slots are also rarely used which makes the deck favourable for new players.",

        text: "#2: Timelord\nInfinite Light, an indestructible trap accessible from the skill, basically makes all your Timelord monsters invincible and solves all of their inherent drawbacks. Even if your opponent manages to remove Infinite Light, your Sephylon and your other Timelords are usually powerful enough to drag your corpse across the finish line. An ideal deck to play during late season in ranked, where opponents are typically unable to get rid of Infinite Light.",

        text: "#3: Dark Magician\nThe Magician’s Magic skill remains as the best skill for Dark Magicians if you’re too poor to afford the expensive Dark Magician support. Magical Dimension is an easily searchable disruption that also summons a Spellcaster for free, and The Dark Magicians can be made easily by the searchable fusion spell to draw a card every turn. The deck has tons of free deck space for staple backrow, so the deck would only get better as you collect more powerful staple backrows.",

Comboing with any 2 Gouki monsters on field can also end on extremely threatening Gouki link monsters that can easily OTK through anything by boosting their ATK with Finishing Move and Twistcobra.

Booster Dragon with Silverrokket can snipe a card out of your opponent’s extra deck, potentially disabling Raging Pendulum. BFD has a very useful quick effect pop, Borreload is a cool boss monster that steals your opponent’s monsters, and having access to DARK generic rank 4 XYZs and level 8 synchros is always nice. The deck has tons of free deck space for staple backrow, so the deck also gets better as you obtain better staple backrow.",
